Changes since 1.00

2013/01/28: 1.02-1

	. Fixes to problems with feature names that are not valid R names.
	. Fixed a problem when using interactions with large numbers of
	  features. This required a switch from the gtools' function
	  combinations to an internal version; hence gtools is not required
	  anymore.

2013/01/23: 1.02

	. Coefficient names in returned models and in
	  featuresInForwardRegression are now easier to read for humans. New
	  argument interactionSeparatorForCoefNames lets the user specify how
	  interaction names are formed.

2013/01/20: 1.01

	. New argument minInBagObs lets user specify the minimum number of
	  unique in-bag observations for each bag. This prevents bags with too
	  few observations that can cause problems when fitting models.

	. Function now works even when there is a single OOB observation in
	  some bags

2013/01/15: 1.00-2

	. Fixed a failure of multi-threaded calculation with more than 100 bags.

2013/01/13: 1.00-1

	. Fixed a bug with default (NULL) nThreads.


Changes to version included in WGCNA

	. Parallelized main loop; number of threads can be controled via
	  argument nThreads

	. bagObsIndex element of output is now nObservationsPerBag times nBags
	  (transposed to what it was before)
